## 2. Components

### 2.1. `inode_ble`

A component to support [iNode.pl](https://inode.pl/) devices
(energy meters and magnetometers).

#### 2.1.1. Example

```yaml
wifi:
  ...
  power_save_mode: none

# the BT window is configured to be a small portion
# of interval to have a lot of time to handle WiFi
esp32_ble_tracker:
  scan_parameters:
    active: false
    interval: 288ms
    window: 144ms

# monitor RSSI and Power, Energy, and Battery Levels
# the `constant` defines a how many pulses are per unit
# ex.: 1500 pulses/kWh
# all sensors of inode_ble:
# - avg_w
# - avg_dm3
# - avg_raw
# - total_kwh
# - total_dm3
# - total_raw
# - battery_level
# - light_level
sensor:
  - platform: ble_rssi
    mac_address: 00:0b:57:36:df:51
    name: "Emeter RSSI"
    icon: mdi:wifi
    expire_after: 10min

  - platform: inode_ble
    mac_address: 00:0b:57:36:df:51
    constant: 1500
    avg_w:
      name: 'Emeter Power'
      expire_after: 10min
    total_kwh:
      name: 'Emeter Energy'
      expire_after: 10min
    battery_level:
      name: 'Emeter Battery Level'
      expire_after: 10min
```

### 2.2. `eq3_v2`

A component to support [eQ-3 Radiator Thermostat Model N](https://www.eq-3.com/products/homematic/detail/radiator-thermostat-model-n.html),
and maybe also other ones.

This uses custom `esp32_ble_clients` implementation to support
Bluetooth on ESP32.

#### 2.2.1. Stability

This is quite challenging to ensure that BT works well with WiFi.
Ideally it is preferred to run only `eq3_v2` component
on a single device, with all basic services. Usage of complex services,
or complex logic can cause stability issues.

I also noticed that extensive logging (like in `VERBOSE` mode)
during the BT connection cases WiFi to loose beacons,
and results in disconnect.

#### 2.2.2. Example

```yaml
wifi:
  ...
  power_save_mode: none

# time is required by `eq3_v2` to send
# an accurate time spec when requesting
# current state
time:
  - platform: sntp
    id: sntp_time

# refresh component state every 30mins,
# and announce it to Home Assistant MQTT
climate:
  - platform: eq3_v2
    id: office_eq3
    name: Office EQ3
    mac_address: 00:1A:22:12:5B:34
    update_interval: 30min
    valve: # optional, allows to see valve state in %
      name: Office EQ3 Valve State
      expire_after: 61min

# allow to force refresh component state
switch:
  - platform: template
    name: "Refresh Office EQ3"
    lambda: "return false;"
    turn_on_action:
      - component.update: office_eq3
```

### 2.3. `e131`

A component to support [E1.31](https://www.doityourselfchristmas.com/wiki/index.php?title=E1.31_(Streaming-ACN)_Protocol). This allows to control addressable LEDs over WiFi, by pushing data right into LEDs.

The most popular application to push data would be: [JINX](http://www.live-leds.de/jinx-v1-3-with-resizable-mainwindow-real-dmx-and-sacne1-31/).

```yaml
e131_custom:
  method: multicast # Register E1.31 to Multicast group
  # method: unicast # Listen only on port

light:
  - platform: neopixelbus
    pin: D4
    method: ESP8266_UART1
    num_leds: 189
    name: LEDs
    effects:
      - e131:
          universe: 1
          channels: RGB
          # channels: RGBW: to support additional W-channel
```

There are three modes of operation:

- `MONO`: this supports 1 channel per LED (luminance), up-to 512 LEDs per universe
- `RGB`: this supports 3 channels per LED (RGB), up-to 170 LEDs (3*170 = 510 bytes) per universe
- `RGBW`: this supports 4 channels per LED (RGBW), up-to 128 LEDs (4*128 = 512 bytes) per universe

If there's more LEDs than allowed per-universe, additional universe will be used.
In the above example of 189 LEDs, first 170 LEDs will be assigned to 1 universe,
the rest of 19 LEDs will be automatically assigned to 2 universe.

It is possible to enable multiple light platforms to listen to the same universe concurrently,
allowing to replicate the behaviour on multiple strips.

Sometimes it might be advised to improved of connection. By default `multicast` is used,
but in some circumstances it might be advised to connect directly via IP to the esp-node.

### 2.4. `adalight`

A component to support [Adalight](https://learn.adafruit.com/adalight-diy-ambient-tv-lighting). This allows to control addressable LEDs over UART, by pushing data right into LEDs.

The most useful to use [Prismatik](https://github.com/psieg/Lightpack) to create an immersive effect on PC.

```yaml
adalight:

uart:
  - id: adalight_uart
    tx_pin: TX
    rx_pin: RX
    baud_rate: 115200

light:
  - platform: neopixelbus
    pin: D4
    method: ESP8266_UART1
    num_leds: 189
    name: LEDs
    effects:
      - adalight:
          uart_id: adalight_uart
```

### 2.5. `WLED`

A component to support [WLED](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/wiki/UDP-Realtime-Control). This allows to control addressable LEDs over WiFi/UDP, by pushing data right into LEDs.

The most useful to use [Prismatik](https://github.com/psieg/Lightpack) to create an immersive effect on PC.

```yaml
wled:

light:
  - platform: neopixelbus
    pin: D4
    method: ESP8266_UART1
    num_leds: 189
    name: LEDs
    effects:
      - wled:
          # port: 21324 # optional port to allow usage of multiple LED strips
```

### 2.6. `memory`

Simple component that periodically prints free memory of node.

```yaml
memory:
```
### 2.4 Comet Blue
Basic component to:
* get the current temperature
* set the target temperature
This component doesn't support scheduling as I do this through Home Assistant by changing the target temperature.

#### 2.4.1 Example configuration
```yaml
wifi:
  ssid: "..."
  password: "..."
  power_save_mode: none

debug:

# Enable logging
logger:
  level: DEBUG

# Enable Home Assistant API
api:

ota:

time:
  - platform: sntp
    id: sntp_time

climate:
  - platform: cometblue
    pin: 0000
    id: trv_cb1
    name: Radiator 1
    mac_address: 01:23:45:56:78:90
    update_interval: 5min
    temperature_offset: 0
    window_open_sensitivity: 4
    window_open_minutes: 10

switch:
  - platform: template
    name: "Refresh Radiator 1"
    lambda: "return false;"
    turn_on_action:
      - component.update: trv_cb1

```
